Arduino with NEO-6M GPS Module

This project demonstrates how to interface an Arduino with a NEO-6M GPS module to read and display GPS data such as latitude, longitude, altitude, and the number of satellites in view.

Introduction
The NEO-6M GPS module is a popular and cost-effective GPS receiver module that provides location data via serial communication. By connecting this module to an Arduino, you can create a GPS receiver to track position data in real-time.

Components
Arduino (e.g., Uno, Nano, Mega)
NEO-6M GPS module
Jumper wires
Breadboard (optional)
